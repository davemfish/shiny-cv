ISSUES:


deal with multiple logfiles in a single workspace, since they don't overwrite each other.

build list of InVEST workspaces

*ggplot update, substitute rcharts?

'additional layer' having negative values in csv

*Add original and difference vals to popup on comparison

*remove popup except on points

**Validate that runs are comparable (same # of points should do it)

* Rebuild and Export differences table
